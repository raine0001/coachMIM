    <h1>About CoachMIM</h1>

    <h2>Why CoachMIM Exists</h2>
    <p>
      CoachMIM was created to simplify health and lifestyle improvement in a world overloaded with
      conflicting advice, extreme programs, and short-term fixes.
    </p>
    <p>Most people do not fail because they lack motivation. They fail because they lack clarity.</p>
    <p>CoachMIM focuses on clarity.</p>
    <p>
      Instead of chasing trends, the platform helps you track what matters, understand patterns in
      your behavior, and make steady, informed improvements over time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Sustainable progress beats intensity every time.</strong></p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Data Creates Awareness</strong><br />You cannot improve what you do not measure. Tracking builds awareness. Awareness builds control.</li>
      <li><strong>Trends Matter More Than Single Days</strong><br />One bad day does not define you. One perfect day does not fix everything. Progress is measured across weeks and months, not moments.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Adjustments Create Big Results</strong><br />Lasting change happens through consistent, manageable improvements, not dramatic overhauls.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CoachMIM supports gradual, realistic progress.</p>

    <h2>What CoachMIM Is</h2>
    <p>
      CoachMIM is a structured wellness tracking and feedback platform designed to help individuals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor key health and lifestyle metrics</li>
      <li>Identify behavioral and performance trends</li>
      <li>Receive personalized, data-based insights</li>
      <li>Improve consistency and accountability</li>
      <li>Build sustainable routines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The system adapts to your goals, whether that includes weight management, strength training,
      mobility, nutrition tracking, sleep optimization, stress management, or overall performance.
    </p>

    <h2>What CoachMIM Is Not</h2>
    <p>CoachMIM is not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A medical provider</li>
      <li>A replacement for licensed healthcare</li>
      <li>A crash diet program</li>
      <li>A hype-driven transformation system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is a guidance and tracking tool designed to support informed decision-making.</p>
    <p>Your health decisions remain yours.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You track relevant metrics consistently.</li>
      <li>CoachMIM analyzes patterns over time.</li>
      <li>The system provides structured feedback.</li>
      <li>You adjust habits gradually and intelligently.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Progress compounds.</strong></p>
    <p>No guesswork. No extremes. Just measurable improvement.</p>

    <h2>Who CoachMIM Is For</h2>
    <p>CoachMIM is built for individuals who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Value structure over chaos</li>
      <li>Prefer data over hype</li>
      <li>Want accountability without pressure</li>
      <li>Care about long-term health, not short-term fixes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whether you are just beginning your wellness journey or refining an already disciplined routine,
      CoachMIM supports clarity and consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy and Control</h2>
    <p><strong>Your data belongs to you.</strong></p>
    <p>
      CoachMIM stores information securely to provide tracking, analysis, and personalized feedback.
      We do not sell personal data.
    </p>
    <p>You may request account deletion at any time.</p>
    <p>Transparency and trust are foundational to the platform.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Vision</h2>
    <p>
      CoachMIM represents a shift away from emotional, reactive health decisions and toward measured,
      informed lifestyle management.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not perfection.<br />
      The goal is progress you can sustain.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Consistency compounds. Clarity empowers. Improvement follows.</strong></p>
